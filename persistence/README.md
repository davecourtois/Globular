# Persistence
### Nothing in this world can take the place of persistence. 
With emergence of [NoSQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL) new kind of databases became use by developper to store application data. The persistence service give access to those data-stores. The interface propose by that service is well suited for document store. At the moment only [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) is implement by the service, but [ArangoDB](https://www.arangodb.com/) and [Couchbase](http://couchdb.apache.org/) will be available soon, depending of interest of developper.
