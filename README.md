## Why Globular?
If gRPC is of great help with service implementation, it does nothing about service management. In fact, service management is out of gRPC  scope, but itâ€™s the main purpose of globular. Managing service manually can be easy if you have only couple of service, and the number of application is limited. Over time number of applications and services has tendency to increase, and when that happened, you can became a victim of your success.

What propertie must be define on a service to make it manageable? To be manageable a service must be,

* Identifiable: The service Id identified a running service on a given server with a given domain. The Id must be unique on the server, and must not change over time, or application that using it will stop working correctly.

* Nameable: Multiple instances of the same service must be able to run at the same time, in redundancy, instance must share the same service name.

* Versionable: Service interface can change overtime, application must be able to get access to specific service version. With version service functionality are not freeze in time.

* Maintainable: When many service instances are running it can be difficult and error prone to update them one by one.

* Available: If a service crash for any reason, it must be restart. Over time loosing service instances can result in unstable applications.

* Reachable: Here tree properties are requires, the domain and the port/proxy pair. Those properties are used to get the instance network address.

* Trustable: Https is here, and TLS is perfectly integrated in gRPC. Globular help you with the creation and the management of certificate. Easy and secure that's what Globular is all about. Not only you can secure the underlying data socket but also you can easly manage who can access ressource and execute method.

* Scalable: Almost every application start small, but with success cames demand, and scalibility must be part of the equation before everything else. Globular let you run your own cloud by creating a Globular Cluster, that's where the project get it's name. The architecture of Globular was created with scalability in mind before anything else.

By using Globular you will be able to manage your microservices and make them avaible to your web-applications.

You can also install globular via docker's image's, [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/globular/globular)

** The vesion 1.0 is available. The website is not 100% finish but installation and quickstart are ready to help you to make your first step. A complete tutorial it's on the way to be complete. All documentation must be written before the end of feburary.

## First Step with Globular

### How to configure your server

Globular is all about gRpc, so the way you communicate with your backend is via gRpc Api. We made use of evan's. If your installation run at localhost without tls, simply run cmd,

``` sh
$ evans --port 10001 -r
```
If your server has a domain and it secured with tls, you must get access to certificate. To do so execute the following command,

``` sh
$ Globular certificates -domain=globular.cloud -path=/tmp -port=80
$ Your certificate are installed: 
$ cacert:  /tmp/config/tls/globular.cloud/ca.crt
$ cert:  /tmp/config/tls/globular.cloud/client.crt
$ certkey:  /tmp/config/tls/globular.cloud/client.pem
```
** Note that you must have Globular in your path or be in the same directory as the exec.

So to log into evans you must do the following command,
``` sh
$ evans --host globular.cloud -r --tls --cacert "/tmp/config/tls/globular.cloud/ca.crt" --cert  "/tmp/config/tls/globular.cloud/client.crt" --certkey "/tmp/config/tls/globular.cloud/client.pem" --port 10003
```
** if you got access denied try the command with sudo, or change permission on the certificate by given read access to your user.

### How to log with a token.

Most of action are not accessible without token. For example you cannot create organization, user without being authenticate as 'sa'. To do so you must autenticate yourself as 'sa' the default password is 'adminadmin'

``` sh
resource.ResourceService@globular.cloud:10003> call Authenticate
name (TYPE_STRING) => sa
password (TYPE_STRING) => adminadmin
{
  "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VybmFtZSI6InNhIiwiZW1haWwiOiJhZG1pbkBnbG9idWxhci5hcHAiLCJleHAiOjE2MDk3NzIyMDB9.tNRE8M_mR8p-mO9a1OoijoFs5D8FDEYK0sp5AKXCOOs"
}
```
Now exit from event and reopen a new session with the token,

``` sh
$ evans --host globular.cloud -r --tls --cacert "/tmp/config/tls/globular.cloud/ca.crt" --cert  "/tmp/config/tls/globular.cloud/client.crt" --certkey "/tmp/config/tls/globular.cloud/client.pem" --port 10003 --header token="eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VybmFtZSI6InNhIiwiZW1haWwiOiJhZG1pbkBnbG9idWxhci5hcHAiLCJleHAiOjE2MDk3NzIyMDB9.tNRE8M_mR8p-mO9a1OoijoFs5D8FDEYK0sp5AKXCOOs"
```
You are now logged as sa and you can create a user and an organization.


### How to register a user.

To register a user from the sa session execute,

``` sh
resource.ResourceService@globular.cloud:10003> call RegisterAccount
account::id (TYPE_STRING) => steve
account::name (TYPE_STRING) => steve
account::email (TYPE_STRING) => steve@globular.cloud
account::password (TYPE_STRING) => 1234
<repeated> account::contacts (TYPE_STRING) => dave
<repeated> account::contacts (TYPE_STRING) => 
<repeated> account::organizations (TYPE_STRING) => globulario
<repeated> account::organizations (TYPE_STRING) => 
<repeated> account::groups (TYPE_STRING) => 
<repeated> account::roles (TYPE_STRING) => 
confirm_password (TYPE_STRING) => 1234
{
  "result": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VybmFtZSI6InN0ZXZlIiwiZW1haWwiOiJzdGV2ZUBnbG9idWxhci5jbG91ZCIsImV4cCI6MTYwOTc3MjUxMX0.iFbxttFitF6VPWGGw5i36cXwdrsAM5DIe6szC-WI-MU"
}
```

### How to register an organization

``` sh
resource.ResourceService@globular.cloud:10003> call CreateOrganization
organization::id (TYPE_STRING) => globulario
organization::name (TYPE_STRING) => globulario
<repeated> organization::accounts (TYPE_STRING) => steve
<repeated> organization::accounts (TYPE_STRING) => dave
<repeated> organization::accounts (TYPE_STRING) => 
<repeated> organization::groups (TYPE_STRING) => 
<repeated> organization::roles (TYPE_STRING) => 
<repeated> organization::applications (TYPE_STRING) => 
{
  "result":true
}
```
### Create a role

There is tow default roles define in Globular, 'sa' and 'guest'. Given 'sa' role to any user can be dangerous, in the other hand 'guest' is to restrictive... In order to give permission to user to execute action you must create role. Here's as example I will create the role 'devel' and set actions in it and also set user's who can play that role...

``` sh
resource.ResourceService@globular.cloud:10003> call CreateRole
role::id (TYPE_STRING) => devel
role::name (TYPE_STRING) => devel
<repeated> role::actions (TYPE_STRING) => /admin.AdminService/PublishService
<repeated> role::actions (TYPE_STRING) => /admin.AdminService/DeployApplication
<repeated> role::actions (TYPE_STRING) => /admin.AdminService/UploadServicePackage
<repeated> role::actions (TYPE_STRING) => 
<repeated> role::members (TYPE_STRING) => steve
<repeated> role::members (TYPE_STRING) => dave
<repeated> role::members (TYPE_STRING) => 
<repeated> role::organizations (TYPE_STRING) => globulario
<repeated> role::organizations (TYPE_STRING) => 
{
  "result": true
}
```
Now user's steve and dave can publish service and deploy application.
